      In Level 1 you can print words and sentences.

      Try the code: `ask Would you like to become an astronaut?`
      Press the green button with 'Run the code' on it, to try the code.

      Did it work? Then put this line below : `echo So your answer is`
      Then press the green button again. Now Hedy repeats your answer!

    start_code: |
      ask Would you like to become an astronaut?
  - step: '2'
    prompt: |
      If you want to live on a different planet, you undoubtedly must be able to grow plants.
      Because bringing enough food with you for your whole life is impossible! That is why in this lesson you are going to learn what plants need to grow.

      You will keep getting a sentence and then you have to complete it with the correct word.
      These are the answers: plants, photosynthesis, oxygen, carbon dioxide, atmosphere, air

      And these are the sentences:
      What is a mix of different gases, like nitrogen and oxygen?

      In Level 1 we cannot check yet if your answer is correct. That will happen in the next levels.

      ask What is a mix of different gases, such as nitrogen and oxygen?

      You have entered Hedy Level 2. That means you can program something new, namely, choosing a random word from a list. This way you can test yourself even better.

      Can you finish the list of words?
      And, can you also make sure that you can enter an answer with an `ask`?
      Read the above explanation carefully, because `ask` works a bit different now!

    start_code: |
      words are plants, photosynthesis
      print words at random

      You have entered Hedy level 3. Printing works a bit differently, you now have to use quotation marks to print.
      We are now going to practice new things in level 3!

      Will you make a program so you can also practice this puzzle?
      In the next step you will learn how to check whether the answer is correct.

    start_code: |
      answer is ask What is the name of the first box?
      print 'Your answer was ' answer
- level: '4'
  assignments:
  - step: '1'
    prompt: |
      Now that you have practiced programming, it is time to learn something new, the `if`.
      With an `if` you can check whether an answer is correct.

      <img src="/images/SpaceEUplantpuzzel.png" width="50%"> </img>

      You will receive some code from us. Can you finish it for all the boxes?

    start_code: |
      answer is ask What is box 1?
      if answer is leaf print 'correct!' else print 'wrong'

  assignments:
  - step: '1'
    prompt: |
      We have now learnt a lot of things about what plants need to grow well.
      How many do you know?
      With the new `repeat` code you can print the same sentence multiple times, give it a try.
      How many do you know? Ask as many times as you want.
    start_code: |
      repeat 1 times answer is ask What does a plant need?

- level: "6"
  assignments:
  - step: '1'
    prompt: |
      You have entered Hedy level 6. In level 6 you can start calculating. That is useful if you have to determine how heavy things can be on the Moon!
      With spaceEU you learned that things on the Moon weigh 6x less than on Earth.
      That means that you have to divide by 6. In Hedy you use the sign / to divide. It is called "slash" (Pronounce: slaSH).
      Can you finish the code?
    start_code: |
      weight is 60
      print 'The weight is' weight
      print 'On the moon that is ...'
  - step: '2'
    prompt: |
      You can make more calculations about the Moon. For example, a day on the Moon is about 29 days.
      Can you calculate with Hedy how long a month is on the Moon?
      You now have to create the code by yourself.
