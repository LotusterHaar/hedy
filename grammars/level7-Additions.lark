program: _EOL* command (_SPACE)* (_EOL+ command (_SPACE)*)* _EOL* //lines may end on spaces and might be separated by many newlines
command: print | repeat | ifs elses? | ask | assign_list | list_access_var | assign  //placing it here means print is will print 'is' and print is Felienne will print 'is Felienne'

repeat: _REPEAT _SPACE (NUMBER | var) _SPACE _TIMES _EOL (_SPACE+ command) (_EOL _SPACE+ command)*

// from level 7 on if is implemented slightly differently
elses: _EOL _ELSE _EOL (_SPACE+ command) (_EOL _SPACE+ command)*
ifs: _IF _SPACE condition _EOL (_SPACE+ command) (_EOL _SPACE+ command)* //'if' cannot be used in Python, hence the name of the rule is 'ifs'
